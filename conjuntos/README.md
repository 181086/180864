Python Program to Illustrate Different Set Operations

  <li>1. In this example, we have defined two set variables and we have performed different set operations: union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference.,  </li>
  <li>2. To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics:  </li>
  <li>3.Python Sets  </li>
  <li>4. Python Input, Output and Import  </li>
  <li>Python offers a datatype called set whose elements must be unique. It can be used to perform different set operations like union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference. </li>
  <li>Is the Quadratic Allocation Problem NP-complete or is it in P? Either give a reduction to show it is NP-complete or give a polytime algorithm to solve it. </li>

 
</ol>
Aside: This problem arose during some consulting I was doing, where the integers represented the sizes of different software jobs, and the quadratic term is there because the cost of implementing software goes up faster than linearly with the size of the job.

In this program, we take two different sets and perform different set operations on them. This can equivalently done by using set methods.
